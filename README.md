# Forum - Backend
This repository aims at a modern backend application relying on [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as it's data source and [Json Web Token](https://jwt.io/) for account recognition and verification (for signing, an [RSA](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA) key pair is used) - alongside a fast & restful API and real-time updates of users, threads and much more via reliable and secure channels.

## Installation, setup and API reference
